I worked with my doctors and our medical team on this formulation for months, making sure we created the most clean, active and gentle supplement for fertility, pregnancy and postpartum. \n \nAfter years of taking other prenatal vitamins, I was still missing many of the key nutrients my doctors recommended. Enter Lemme Mama üëºüèº\n\n90% of pregnant women are not getting enough Choline in their diet, which is why we included 3x the amount of Choline found in other supplements. We also knew how important it was to formulate with the most active form of Folate (Methylated Folate) to support baby‚Äôs brain development. \n\nWith over 25 active nutrients, Lemme Mama has helped support my energy, immunity and nutrition for all stages of my pregnancy. Feeling incredibly blessed and proud of what we‚Äôve developed ü§ç\n\n11.2.23. Join the waitlist.",
