            "post_caption": "A decade‚Ä¶ ten long years‚Ä¶ and yet it feels like yesterday when we were singing happy birthday to you for the big 40!\n\nThe world isn‚Äôt the same brother‚Ä¶ as a species, one might say we are struggling. But I think of you, and I smile and know everything is going to be alright. \n\nI was going through images to celebrate this sacred day. Memories flashing before me, one better than the next‚Ä¶ but I couldn‚Äôt get past this one. Funny, the little angel came into the office, and looked over my shoulder. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs such a timeless photo, Dad‚Ä¶ one that will live on for generations of humanity‚Ä¶‚Äù \n\nOf course I don‚Äôt turn around, haha no need for the kid to see his pops worked up eyes. As he leaves he says ‚Äúit‚Äôs why I want to build cars, for him‚Äù. \n\nHe wasn‚Äôt even born yet. It would be seven months later when you would tell the crew and the Fast production ‚ÄúVins gotta get to New York to receive his son‚Äù. You had that ability to refocus everyone including a whole production to the important things in life. \n\nFor me this picture represents the moment I knew we would be brothers for eternity. January 2010, the night before you and I went to Haiti‚Ä¶ the passion and joy you had to simply help people. You said first responders shouldn‚Äôt have to wait for anyone‚Ä¶ and that you wanted to dedicate your life to that. First responders‚Ä¶ that was your true self, and you were sharing it with me, your brother. Haha. To this day, I imagine if you looked up ‚Äúfirst responder‚Äù in the dictionary, there would be a picture of you. Haha.  So as much as I would like to think we would be cutting cake and singing happy birthday for the big 50! We probably wouldn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ cause you would be in Maui or Morocco, or anywhere in this planet where people were in need. \n\nI miss you‚Ä¶ I love you, and I will continue to honor the beautiful soul you are. \n\nHappy Birthday‚Ä¶",
