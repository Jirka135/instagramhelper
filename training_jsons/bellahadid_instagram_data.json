            "post_caption": "Proud to be included in the 2023 #TIME100 @Time list of the most influential people in the world. \n\nIn awe of this achievement, and being able to be recognized along side so many talented, hardworking and life changing people. These are human beings challenging government systems, inventing world changing products, and being a light for many, in a world of darkness. Not to say I haven‚Äôt gone head to head with government systems before , but there is still a lot I have to do and a lot that has to be done. \nThe truth is, to say I am anywhere near as influential as some of these big names, is a huge statement to make, but please know,I can feel the weight and understand my responsibilities within it. To be recognized for the work I‚Äôve done, just makes me want to work harder to be a part of the change we want to see in this world. I know my mission is much larger than what I have even touched the surface on now, and I will continue to fight until change has been made. \n\nI will always do my best to spread the message of kindness, advocating for mental health and chronic illness, while continuing to stand up for what I know in my heart, to be right, when it comes to the refugee crisis, governmental pawns, border control issues and systematic oppression. I will always be a supporter for the oppressed and anyone less fortunate, no matter whose feathers it ruffles. Helping others is my passion& I will never stop, no matter what. It‚Äôs important for me to always speak my truth, and be as genuine as I can with you all, so to get on this list just by being myself and advocating from my heart, is a blessing in itself. \nWORDS BY @cturlington ‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüèΩ‚ù§Ô∏è\nChristy - your words have me sitting in much gratitude. To know that you, the queen of beauty, integrity&kindness, have this to say about me means the world,& I have no words to describe how I feel that YOU took the time to write this tribute for me. Thank you Christy. Your light , heart, hardwork& spirit have infected the fashion industry& the world,& I am inspired by you to always follow my heart and stand up for what I believe in.",

US White House National Security Council dangerously says Israel 'owes no-one any justification' and that it will have 'no red lines.' Innocent lives should always be justified in the name of humanity. \n\nIsrael has completely shut off telecommunications and electricity across Gaza. Injured civilians currently can‚Äôt call ambulances. Medics are begging reporters to let them know where bombardments are happening, but reporters don‚Äôt know either because of the internet outage. The people of Gaza have no where to go. Children are dying . Please . #ceasefirenow .",
