(And not to brag, but I totally beat @OrlandoBloom in front of everyone too 😈🙃)\n\nI’d like to send a huge and sincere thank you to all who participated in the tournament, bought a ticket, volunteered, donated, and showed their support from near and far. \n\nThank you to our sponsors for making our pickle dreams come true:\nDirect Management Group\n@celsiusofficial\nNKSFB\n@gt_law\n@stanley_brand\n@civileapparel\n@selkirksport\n@malkorganics\n@jdsportsus\n\nYou’ve all helped ignite the light in some amazing kids.
