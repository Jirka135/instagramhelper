A goal we have to achieve as it directly affects the others. The SDGs have to be achieved by 2030 and we are nowhere close.\n\nBut with the private sector setting an example, like in this case VS announcing The Tour Impact Fund that will serve by creating opportunities for women artists and entrepreneurs around the world, I‚Äôm sure we will be able to get as close as we can to what seems like an impossible achievement at the moment. \n\nEach step counts.\n\n #UNGA @goalshouse",
