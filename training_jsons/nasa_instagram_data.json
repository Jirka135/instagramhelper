The pulsar, a fast spinning dense neutron star, can be seen as a bright white spot near the base of the palm. The new combination with IXPE reveals the magnetic field ‚Äúbones‚Äù of this remarkable structure. IXPE observed this pulsar, MSH 15-52, for 17 days which is the longest it has looked at any single object since it launched in December 2021. ‚Å£\n‚Å£\nThe second image shows the magnetic field map in MSH 15-52. In this image, short straight lines represent IXPE polarization measurements, mapping the direction of the local magnetic field. Orange ‚Äúbars‚Äù mark the most precise measurements, followed by cyan and blue bars with less precise measurements. The complex field lines follow the `wrist', 'palm' and 'fingers' of the hand, and probably help define the extended finger-like structures.‚Å£\n‚Å£\nThe amount of polarization ‚Äî indicated by bar length ‚Äî is remarkably high, reaching the maximum level expected from theoretical work. To achieve that strength, the magnetic field must be very straight and uniform, meaning there is little turbulence in those regions of the pulsar wind nebula.‚Å£\n‚Å£\nImage description: ‚Å£\n1-  A composite image of a pulsar wind nebula, which strongly resembles a ghostly purple hand with sparkling fingertips. The three longest fingertips of the hand-shape point toward our upper right, or 1:00 on a clock face. There, a small, mottled, orange and yellow cloud appears to sparkle or glow like embers. This orange cloud is part of the remains of the supernova explosion that created the pulsar. The backdrop of stars was captured in infrared light. ‚Å£\n2-  The second image is the same as the first, this time with magnetic field vectors in orange, cyan and blue.

Interacting gravitationally toward one another, these galaxies lie about 500 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Tucana. ‚Å£\n‚Å£\nThe interacting galaxy pair is known as Arp-Madore, which is a collection of peculiar galaxies. What is peculiar about this group? There are actually three galaxies, not just two. If you look at the smaller galaxy‚Äôs upper arm on the lower right corner of the image, you can spot the knot-like structure. As seen from Earth‚Äôs perspective, astronomers have found it challenging to differentiate whether an object in space is one, or multiple objects, or lying in front of another. Astronomers discovered the third knot-like galaxy by analyzing the speed and direction which revealed that the redshift, the wavelength of light is seen ‚Äúshifted‚Äù towards the red part of the spectrum making it its own entity. ‚Å£\n‚Å£\nImage description:  Two spiral galaxies. Each glows brightly in the center, where a bar stretches from side to side. The upper one is rounder, and its arms form two thin rings. The lower galaxy is flatter and its arms make one outer ring; a dusty knot atop its upper arm marks out a third object. Gravity is pulling gas and dust together where the galaxies come close. A number of small galaxies surround them on a black background.‚Å£\n‚Å£\nCredit: ESA/Hubble and NASA, J. Dalcanton, Dark Energy Survey/ DOE/ FNAL/ NOIRLab/ NSF/ AURA; Acknowledgement: L.

It is the remains of a massive explosion which occurred with when two white dwarfs merged or when a white dwarf pulled too much mass from a companion star ‚Äì creating what is thought to be the brightest stellar event recorded in history.‚Å£\n‚Å£\nImage description: The debris from an exploded star resembles a mottled red ball of churning fire against a softer backdrop of stars.

Within this circle, only the outer ring of the supernova remnant is shown, not the mottled red stellar material churning inside. This ring is part of the supernova's expanding blast wave, which has been observed in X-ray light by both Chandra and IXPE.

When ionization happens, it means that atoms and molecules become charged due to the high-energy environment they are in which causes them to lose some electrons. The protostellar jets have collimated beams of matter that are ejected from young stars called protostars. Collimated means that the matter is ejected in a parallel direction which resembles a column-like shape. ‚Å£\n‚Å£\nImage description: A nebula with stars.

If we‚Äôre naming it technically it is a SABc-type galaxy. Let‚Äôs break down what that means:‚Å£\n‚Å£\nS-The well-defined arms of bright stars and darker dust that curl outwards from the galaxy‚Äôs dense and bright core identifies the galaxy as Spiral. ‚Å£\n‚Å£\nAB ‚Äì Many spiral galaxies do not spiral out from a single point, but rather from an elongated bar-type structure. This one in particular is considered ‚Äúweakly barred‚Äù giving it its AB designation. ‚Å£\n‚Å£\nc ‚Äì The lowercase ‚Äòc‚Äô identifies how tightly wound the spiral arms are. Where ‚Äòa‚Äô would indicate very tightly wound, and ‚Äòd‚Äô very loosely wound. ‚Å£\n‚Å£\nAs the capabilities of our telescopes grow, the catalogues of our findings evolve, as well -- and this is one of the ways we keep track of it all! ‚Å£\n‚Å£\nImage Description: A close-in view of a spiral galaxy. We see it face-on, showing its circular shape and tightly winding spiral arms. The galaxy glows in golden hue brightly in the center and dims to cool blue tones toward the edge. Dark, faint filaments of dust and brightly-glowing fuchsia pink and orange bubbles of star formation mark the face of the galaxy. ‚Å£\n‚Å£\nCredit: NASA/ESA Hubble R.

At just a million years old, this bright young star formation contains thousands of new stars with ranges of masses. They call it mosaic for a reason. This nebula contains a treasure trove of diversity for astronomers which include outflows, embedded protostars, brown dwarfs, free-floating planetary objects, and planet-forming disks around young stars. ‚Å£\n‚Å£\n@NASAWebb's near-infrared camera, NIRCam, captured new imaging of the nebula that was made into some of the largest Webb mosaics observed to date. This image is the long-wavelength color composite, which focuses on the gas, dust, and molecules in the region with unprecedented sensitivity in the thermal infrared.‚Å£\n‚Å£\nImage description: An image of a young star-forming region filled with wispy purple, green, and red nebulosity. The purple ionized gas is seen mostly towards the center, with browns, greens, and reds behind, while the periphery is mostly bright green and darker brown to the left. There is a large spray of yellow, orange, red, and purple towards the top center, and the nebula fades to near black to the right. There are thousands of stars sprinkled across the field, concentrated towards the center, but they generally appear fainter at longer wavelengths, with some exceptions. The brightest sources in the field have extensive diffraction spikes characteristic of Webb.‚Å£\n‚Å£\nCredit: NASA, ESA, CSA / Science leads and image processing: M. McCaughrean, S.
